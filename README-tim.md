Additional notes to README.md

To "run" web version in dist:

* Can serve it using `http-server -p 8080`
  (Get http-server with `sudo npm install -g http-server`)
  Just running off file `dist/index.html` fails to render.

* Works best with Chromium.
  Debian's ancient Firefox ESR quite slow to render globe.
